By utilizing modern electric meters, it possible to collect and store enormous amount of data about household energy consumption. This data can be used to predict
energy consumption and help energy providers manage energy (electricity) output and plan for energy peaks/lows. It can also help the indiviudal resident keep track
of their energy usage and perhaps even recommend energy saving actions. 

As the human population increases, it is vital to lower the energy footprint of each individual and save the limited resources earth has to offer to future generations.
Household energy consumption is a big part of our total energy consumption, and new technology offers new ways of decreasing it.
