## Introduction

By utilizing modern electric meters, it possible to collect and store enormous amount of data about building energy consumption. This data can be used to predict
energy consumption and help energy providers manage energy output and plan for energy peaks/lows. It can also help the individual resident keep track
of their energy usage, as well as being analysed for possible energy saving retrofits.

Most buildings that will exist by mid-century have already been built and in use. As the human population increases, it is vital to lower the energy footprint of existing buildings and conserve the limited resources Earth has to offer. This can be achieved by collecting detailed and complete energy use data of the exising buildings using smart meters, and feed the data into building energy models for analysis (Figure {@fig:image1}). In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been explored to act in place of traditional physics-based building energy models and their performances validated.

This project focuses on predicting building energy consumption based on the Kaggle competition "ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III". The main goal of the project is first and foremost to create a ML model that can predict the energy usage of a building as accurately as possible, based on different input data such as air temperature, building size etc. In addition to that, different ML models are explored to investigate which one works the best for this particular competition.
